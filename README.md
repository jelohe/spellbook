# Spellbook

A website to create, store and share your magic snippets.

This is a small personal project to learn and practice Elixir language with the Phoenix framework.

## Development

To start your local Phoenix development server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Deploy
